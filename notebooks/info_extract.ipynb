For types of data, choose from the following: street view image, geo-tagged photos, aerial image, video, virtual reality, others. For the data source, provide sources of the images/videos: i.e. where they collected them, and specific service names if possible (e.g., Google Street View, Baidu Map). For the number/volume of images, answer how many images (e.g., street view image) were downloaded/obtaine/used or how long were the videos.
